# QDCT-based-Markov-features
648-dimensional QDCT based Markov features are extracted from images for digital image forgery detection.

The extracted features are stored in Excel file format. casiav1_data.xlsx and caisav2_final2.xlsx are the features of the images from CASIA v1 and CASIA v2 datasets, 649th column contains the target class where 1 belongs to the forged class and 0 belongs to original image. These features can further be used to train a Machine learning model to classify the images.
